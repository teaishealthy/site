  <h1>Hi there, I'm tea&nbspðŸ‘‹</h1>
  <p class="main-content">
    Hey, I'm tea, a professional programmer and a computer science student at
    FOM University in Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª. I started out as an aspiring developer and now
    get to turn my passion for coding into both work and study. I love building
    things in Python and creating cross-platform apps with Dart and Flutter. I'm
    a big fan of open source, and I enjoy contributing to projects that I find
    interesting or that challenge me in new ways.
  </p>

  <p class="main-content">
    I really enjoy working with APIs and figuring out how to make different
    systems talk to each other. Whether it's building bots, automating tasks, or
    creating tools to improve workflows, I like experimenting with frameworks
    and writing my own (meta-)frameworks to make things more efficient and fun
    to use.
  </p>

  <p class="main-content">
    Outside of APIs and backend work, I spend a lot of time creating websites
    and web apps. I like using different languages and frameworks to build
    things that are clean, functional, and easy to use.
  </p>

  <p class="main-content">
    If you'd like to get in touch, the best way is through Discord â€” I'm always
    active there, so you're most likely to catch me quickly. You can also reach
    me by email, but I might miss it, so don't hesitate to follow up if I don't
    respond right away. If you're on Keybase, feel free to message me there too
    (see links below)!
